# Neural Networks From Scratch
## Description:-
A customized NeuralNetwork class for classification tasks. The class also implements regularization and eases the application of regularization to the neural network. The following are the descriptions of the important function of the class.

### gradientDescent:-
It performs Gradient Descent with iters as no. of iterations, alpha as the learning rate and lambda as regularization factor.
### predict:-
It performs Forward Propogation on the neural network to classify the input.
### getCostAndGradient:-
It performs Backward Propogation to calculate the gradients for each parameter
